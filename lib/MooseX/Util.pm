=head1 NAME

MooseX::Util - Moose::Util extensions

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.004 of MooseX::Util - released May 07, 2015 as part of MooseX-Util.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MooseX::Util qw{ ensure_all_roles with_traits };

    # profit!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a utility module that handles all of the same functions that
L<Moose::Util> handles.  In fact, most of the functions exported by this
package are simply re-exports from L<Moose::Util>, so you're recommended to
read the documentation of that module for a comprehensive view.

However.

We've re-implemented a number of the functions our parent provides, for a
variety of reasons.  Those functions are documented here.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 with_traits(<classname> => (<trait1>, ... ))

Given a class and one or more traits, we construct an anonymous class that is
a subclass of the given class and consumes the traits given.  This is exactly
the same as L<Moose::Util/with_traits>, except that we use
L<MooseX::Util::Meta::Class/create_anon_class> to construct the anonymous
class, rather than L<Moose::Meta::Class/create_anon_class> directly.

Essentially, this means that when we do:

    my $anon_class_name = with_traits('Zombie::Catcher', 'SomeTrait');

For $anon_class_name we get:

    Zombie::Catcher::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

Rather than:

    Moose::Meta::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::1

This is nice because we have an idea of where the first anonymous class came
from, whereas the second one could could be from anywhere.

=head2 is_private

    # true if "private"
    ... if is_private('_some_name');

Ofttimes we need to determine if a name is considered "private" or not.  By convention,
method, attribute, and other names are considered private if their first character is
an underscore.

While trivial to test for, this allows us to centralize the tests in one place.

Please note B<I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed for this work>,
rather B<it is simply a very pleasant surprise>. I largely create and release
works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable; however, don't let
that stop you if you feel like it ;)
